# AE-GRAINS-MIDI
MIDI-controlled firmwares for the GRAINS module in the AE Modular format by Tangible Waves.

WARNING: this is an experimental firmware, use at your own risk. There is a possibility that your grains module will be bricked when uploading new firmwares (see this AE Modular forum post for a description of the possible problem and solution: https://forum.aemodular.com/thread/1858/serialport-show-anymore-brick-grains).

These firmwares rely on the Arduino MIDI library. For more information and installation instructions, visit https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library

Tri-shape and wavegrains firmwares also rely on the Arduino Ramp library (https://github.com/siteswapjuggler/RAMP)
